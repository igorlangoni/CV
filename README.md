## Skills

#### Problem-Solving
While working in a fast-paced, dynamic environment such as a production kitchen I have put my problem-solving skills to the test almost on a daily basis. Regular occurrences included absent team members, last-minute orders and delays from suppliers. I have always managed to overturn these situations by reallocating resources and prioritizing tasks in order to maximize efficiency and deliver our products on time and up to standards. 

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while working as a supervisor and as a waiter in many different ways. As a team leader, I always had to be clear when giving instructions and setting expectations with my teammates. Both when dealing with coworkers and when dealing with guests as a waiter, I had to learn how to actively listen and understand concerns and requests, as to de-escalate situations and resolve conflicts.

#### Analytical Skills
Both through my 2 and half years as a Chemical Engineer Undergraduate in Brazil, through my time as a production supervisor and especially through the data bootcamp, I have developed strong mathematical and analytical skills. I have a keen eye for problem identification and strategic planning, which were very useful during our project weeks in the bootcamp. 



## Hobbies

My true passions are sports and music (old music mostly)! But I am also always in the mood to play some video-game or some strategy board game with a fun, big group of friends!
