## Igor Langoni


I am a detail-oriented problem-solver transitioning into a data engineering career . Having just completed a 16-week long Data Engineering bootcamp I have acquired skills in many of the most sought after tools in the data world. The tech world is amazing and because I believe I have the right attitude and mindset I know I will thrive in the right company with the right values!

- Any experience relevent to software development

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Problem-Solving
While working in a fast-paced, dynamic environment such as a production kitchen I have put my problem-solving skills to the test almost on a daily basis. Regular occurrences included absent team-members, last-minute orders and delays from suppliers. I have always managed to overturn these situations by reallocating resources and prioritizing tasks in order to maximize efficiency and deliver our products on time and up to standards. 

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while working as a supervisor in many different ways. As a team leader I always had to be clear when giving instructions and setting expectations with my teammates. I also learned how to actively listen and understand their concerns and requests. 


#### Analytical Skills
Both through my 2 and half years as a Chemical Engineer Undergraduate in Brazil, through my time as a production supervisor and specially through the data bootcamp, I have developed strong mathematical and analytical skills. I have a keen eye for problem identification and strategic planning, which were very useful during our project weeks in the bootcamp. 


## Education

#### Makers Academy, Data Engineering Bootcamp (September 2023 to January 2024)
- Achieved excellent command of Python through a series of exercises, challenges and projects
- Frequently used pairing in order to problem-solve efficiently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- Applied Test-driven Development techniques to improve code quality and ensure continuous integration
- Delivered business insights through the use of SQL queries in order to come up with meaningful data
- Worked with several data engineering tools such as Apache Airflow, dbt, Kafka, AWS (S3, RDS, EC2)
- Developed organizational skills by working in group projects following Agile methodology


#### Uberlandia Federal University, Brazil (January 2015 to September 2018)
##### Chemical Engineering Undergraduate Degree
  
  Deep understanding of Math and Statistics
  Analytical thinking
  Data-driven solutions


#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

My true passions are sports and music (old music mostly)! But I am also always in the mood to play some video-game or some strategy board game with a fun, big group of friends!
