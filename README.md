I am a detail-oriented problem-solver transitioning into a data engineering career . Having just completed a 16-week long Data Engineering bootcamp I have acquired skills in many of the most sought after tools in the data world. The tech world is amazing and because I believe I have the right attitude and mindset I know I will thrive in the right company with the right values!


## Projects

| Name                         | Description         | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | -----------------   | ----------------- |
| Pisa2018 Dashboard (Data Pipeline) | A batch processing pipeline to feed a real-time dashboard app with transformed data from several source databases that were continuously updated.| Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, Apache Airflow, Flask, AWS RDS, AWS EC2, Git |                     
| MakersBNB | A webapp based on the world famous AirBNB. It enabled users to start sessions via authenticated login with encrypted passwords; browse different spaces and dates available to rent; Request spaces at certain available dates; Offer owned spaces for rent at different available dates; Manage request, accept or decline space’s requests | Python, Flask, Git
| Netflix Dashboard | The aim of the project was to come up with a dashboard for Netflix management, based on their movie catalog dataset. Management wanted insights on the best month to release a movie and whether their movie catalog was out of date | Python, Docker, dbt, Metabase, Postgres, SQL

- Learned how to communicate effectively and how to actively listen to concerns and requests by dealing regularly with unhappy guests

## Skills

#### Problem-Solving
While working in a fast-paced, dynamic environment such as a production kitchen I have put my problem-solving skills to the test almost on a daily basis. Regular occurrences included absent team-members, last-minute orders and delays from suppliers. I have always managed to overturn these situations by reallocating resources and prioritizing tasks in order to maximize efficiency and deliver our products on time and up to standards. 

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while working as a supervisor and as a waiter in many different ways. As a team leader I always had to be clear when giving instructions and setting expectations with my teammates. Both when dealing with coworkers and when dealing with guests as a waiter, I had to learn how to actively listen and understand concerns and requests, as to descalate situations and resolve conflicts.

#### Analytical Skills
Both through my 2 and half years as a Chemical Engineer Undergraduate in Brazil, through my time as a production supervisor and specially through the data bootcamp, I have developed strong mathematical and analytical skills. I have a keen eye for problem identification and strategic planning, which were very useful during our project weeks in the bootcamp. 



## Hobbies

My true passions are sports and music (old music mostly)! But I am also always in the mood to play some video-game or some strategy board game with a fun, big group of friends!
