## Igor Langoni


I am a detail-oriented problem-solver transitioning into a data engineering career . Having just completed a 16-week long Data Engineering bootcamp I have acquired skills in many of the most sought after tools in the data world. The tech world is amazing and because I believe I have the right attitude and mindset I know I will thrive in the right company with the right values!

## Work Experience

**Paul Rhodes Bakery**  (January 2022 to August 2023) 
Production Supervisor

. Oversaw teams, processes, and quality in the food industry

## Skills

#### Problem-Solving
While working in a fast-paced, dynamic environment such as a production kitchen I have put my problem-solving skills to the test almost on a daily basis. Regular occurrences included absent team-members, last-minute orders and delays from suppliers. I have always managed to overturn these situations by reallocating resources and prioritizing tasks in order to maximize efficiency and deliver our products on time and up to standards. 

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while working as a supervisor in many different ways. As a team leader I always had to be clear when giving instructions and setting expectations with my teammates. I also learned how to actively listen and understand their concerns and requests. 


#### Analytical Skills
Both through my 2 and half years as a Chemical Engineer Undergraduate in Brazil, through my time as a production supervisor and specially through the data bootcamp, I have developed strong mathematical and analytical skills. I have a keen eye for problem identification and strategic planning, which were very useful during our project weeks in the bootcamp. 



## Hobbies

My true passions are sports and music (old music mostly)! But I am also always in the mood to play some video-game or some strategy board game with a fun, big group of friends!
